[{"content":"Hello, future me, and any friends who may happen to visit.\nWelcome to the beginning of \u0026ldquo;Wandering TideCatcher.\u0026rdquo; This space is envisioned as a basket to hold the \u0026ldquo;shells\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;stars\u0026rdquo; I pick up along the shores of knowledge and information. Today, I\u0026rsquo;m placing the first carefully chosen shell inside—a guide on how to create content here.\nThis post serves as both a memento and a guide, ensuring that every future act of creation is clear and efficient.\nI. The Starting Point: A Single Command We don\u0026rsquo;t create files manually. Instead, we use HUGO\u0026rsquo;s elegant command-line tool. It\u0026rsquo;s like a magic wand that prepares everything for us.\nOpen your terminal, navigate to the blog\u0026rsquo;s root directory, and recite the spell:\n# Format: hugo new content-type/YYYY/MM/your-post-slug/index.lang.md hugo new posts/2024/07/a-new-journey/index.en.md This command performs a bit of magic:\nIt creates a folder named a-new-journey within the content/posts/2024/07/ directory. Inside that folder, it creates an index.en.md file. It automatically populates this file with \u0026ldquo;identity information\u0026rdquo; (the Front Matter), including the title, date, and a crucial flag: draft: true. This flag marks it as a draft, visible in local previews but ignored during final deployment, which is very safe. When we\u0026rsquo;ve finished writing and are ready for the world to see, we simply change draft: true to draft: false.\nII. Giving It Soul: Words and Images A complete article is composed of both text and images. In our well-designed structure, managing them becomes incredibly simple.\n1. Words Below the file\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;identity information\u0026rdquo; is where we let our words flow. It follows standard Markdown syntax—concise and powerful.\n2. Images: An End to Chaos This is the most beautiful part of our workflow. Every article has its own dedicated folder, which means all the images used in the article can be stored right alongside the article itself!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re writing this a-new-journey post. Its directory structure looks like this:\ncontent/ └── posts/ └── 2024/ └── 07/ └── a-new-journey/ \u0026lt;-- The article\u0026#39;s dedicated folder ├── index.en.md \u0026lt;-- The article file itself └── journey-start.jpg \u0026lt;-- Its companion image! How do you reference this image?\nIn your index.en.md file, you just need to write the following, without any complex paths:\n![The Journey Begins](journey-start.jpg) It\u0026rsquo;s that simple! The image and text are elegantly \u0026ldquo;bundled\u0026rdquo; together, making migration, backup, and management a worry-free experience.\nIII. The Article\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;ID Card\u0026rdquo;: Front Matter The area at the top of each article, wrapped in ---, is its metadata. It determines how the article is categorized and displayed.\ntitle: The title of the article. date: The publication date, which determines its position in the archives. categories: The category, usually a single, broad classification like [\u0026quot;Tech Notes\u0026quot;] or [\u0026quot;Life Reflections\u0026quot;]. tags: Tags, which can be multiple and are used for more granular indexing, like [\u0026quot;Go\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Web\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Performance Tuning\u0026quot;]. summary: A short summary that will be displayed on the article list page. draft: false means the article is published; true means it\u0026rsquo;s a draft. Carefully filling out this information will keep our knowledge base neat and organized.\nConclusion The creative process should be a joy, not a burden.\nStart the journey with hugo new, place words and images in their dedicated folder, and finally, brush off the draft dust. This is the entire secret to recording every discovery here at \u0026ldquo;Wandering TideCatcher.\u0026rdquo;\nMay this little basket grow fuller with each passing day.\n","date":"2024-07-25T11:00:00+08:00","permalink":"https://gnailcn.github.io/en/posts/2024/07/first-post-a-guide-to-building-wandering-tidecatcher/","title":"First Post: A Guide to Building 'Wandering TideCatcher'"}]
